# AWS GuardDuty Threat Detection Simulation 🚨

A hands-on demonstration of AWS GuardDuty’s threat detection capabilities using simulated findings in a secure, isolated AWS Free Tier environment.

## 📌 Objectives
- Simulate common cloud-based attack scenarios using GuardDuty’s built-in sample findings.
- Analyze and classify multiple threat categories.
- Deep dive into a high-severity detection (process injection attack).
- Practice structured investigation and remediation workflows.
- Export and review simulated finding data in JSON format.

## 📊 Key Takeaways
- Operationalized AWS-native security services without requiring agents.
- Investigated advanced runtime evasion techniques using GuardDuty, CloudTrail, and VPC Flow Logs.
- Developed a practical, cloud-focused incident response process.

## 📑 Deliverables
- 📄 GuardDuty Simulation Report (PDF)
- 📊 Simulated Findings (JSON)
